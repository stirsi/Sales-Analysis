**Product Sales Analysis Project Summary**

In this project, I analyzed sales data for a company to provide actionable insights and optimize their sales strategy. The focus was on three sales methods: Email, Call, and Email + Call, with the goal of identifying revenue trends and optimizing resource allocation.

Key actions included:
- Data cleaning and validation (fixing missing values, correcting inconsistent entries).
- Exploratory analysis of revenue distribution across sales methods, states, and customer tenure.
- Forecasting future revenue trends based on historical data.

**Key Findings:**
- The **Email + Call** method showed the most potential for long-term revenue growth.
- **Call** method, though labor-intensive, generated the least revenue.
- **State analysis** revealed that California, Texas, New York, and Florida were the highest revenue-generating states.

**Recommendations:**
- Invest more in the **Email + Call** method to maximize future revenue.
- Prioritize sales efforts in high-revenue states.
- Optimize or scale back the **Call** method to improve efficiency.

This project provided valuable insights to streamline the company's sales strategy and improve overall performance.
